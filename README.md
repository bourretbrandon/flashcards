Simple education tool to help kids actually learn basic math tables without using their smartphones.

So simple and intuitive (one button) that usage instructions are definitely not necessary.

This app (and all others I publish so far) are PORTABLE APPS. That means there is no need for installation because all the program assets (images, fonts,
.dll, and .so files) are packaged into the executable. Simply double-click and GO! Having said this, let me explain that some Windows users may get a
false positive warning about this app being a "Trojan". Why? Because when you execute the app, it unpacks all the aforementioned program assets into a
temporary folder on your computer. Therefore, some anti-virus apps falsely identify this as malicious "Trojan Horse" activity. Please rest assured that
this app is completely harmless - I would not put my real name on a malicious app.

I develop using ActivePerl (don't laugh, it's rapid development!) and "compile" with ActiveState's Perl Dev Kit (PDK).
